Have you ever booked a hotel online? Then you've probably used D-EDGE without knowing it. Every day, we help more than 12,000 hotels worldwide to develop their online visibility and sales through a range of SaaS and digital marketing solutions.

Amongst the 350 D-EDGERS, the R&D team is made up of a hundred or so enthusiasts who are reinventing hotel booking for both the traveller and the hotelier. As a subsidiary of the Accor group, D-EDGE simplifies the life of independent hotels and hotel chains alike.

Contact us if you have anything to share or some questions!
