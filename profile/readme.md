Have you ever booked a hotel online? Then you've probably used D-EDGE without knowing it. Every day, we help more than 12,000 hotels worldwide to develop their online visibility and sales through a range of SaaS and digital marketing solutions.

Amongst the 350 D-EDGERS, the R&D team is made up of a hundred or so enthusiasts who are reinventing hotel booking for both the traveller and the hotelier. As a subsidiary of the Accor group, D-EDGE simplifies the life of independent hotels and hotel chains alike.

Contact us if you have anything to share or some questions!

## üëã Come to our next meetup

Docker, docker-compose, CI/CD, Kubernetes are some of the new tools and concepts popular in back-end development these days.
Tons of online resources are available to use the tools individually.

But how to make them work together?

In the next D-EDGE Tech Meetup, David will show how to get the most out of these tools together with a concrete example from his daily work.
All developers are welcome (junior and senior), mainly back-end developers.
